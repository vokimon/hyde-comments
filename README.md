hyde-comments: Static comments for Hyde static web generator
============================================================

What?
-----

This is an extension of [Hyde] static web generator to incorporate
comments into your blog post while retaining both data and
simple server requirements.

Why?
----

Most people using static blog generators don't have comments
or they rely on external services like [Disqus] which allow
with an statically added Javascript, generate html for the
comment content and management.

So, why that approach is not enough?
You should read the following [post][JeckyllStaticCommentsPost] by Matt Palmer
the author of an equivalent extension for [Jeckyll] (Ruby based alter ego of Hyde).

In summary:

* I want to have control over my data. I don't want to rely on an external service but the hosting.
* I want my blogging tools be free software (as in freedom, not gratis)

Documentation
-------------

Currently, the behaviour of the extension is not yet well-defined.
Please, meanwhile rely on the examples which are pretty explanatory and on (glups!) the code.

Status and roadmap
------------------

This software is work in progress.
